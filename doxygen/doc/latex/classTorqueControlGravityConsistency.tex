\subsection{Detailed Description}
The test is supposed to be run with the i\+Cub fixed to the pole, with the pole leveled with respect to the gravity (please check this with a level before running the test) and with the whole\+Body\+Dynamics(\+Tree) running. 

The tests opens the whole\+Body\+Interface (to be migrated to use material available on Y\+A\+RP and i\+Dyn\+Tree) and compares the gravity compensation torque coming from the model and assuming that the gravity is fixed in the based with the joint torques measured by i\+Cub (that actually come from the whole\+Body\+Dynamics(\+Tree) ).
